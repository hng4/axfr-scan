# axfr-scan
This program attempts to grab an AXFR dump of a zone file, It queries all nameservers of a TLD and requests an AXFR dump, It will not grab the whole dump, it only graps a few lines, so when the program is finished, go into the 'tld' folder and you'll see something like TLD.txt, this indicates a dump was successful. 

Use at your own risk, etc, No resale of caught zones, I disclaim all responsibility.
